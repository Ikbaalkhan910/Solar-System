It's a passion project I built from scratch on GitHub: a fully interactive Solar System experience. 🌌
From the orbital physics to the little details like Saturn’s rings and Pluto’s lonely path, I poured everything into this.

It’s not just code—it’s my love for space, design, and learning, all wrapped into one.
Feel free to explore the planets, zoom around, and maybe even find a few Easter eggs hidden in the stars. 🚀✨

Let me know what you think—or even better, contribute if you’re into open-source! 🌍🔧
